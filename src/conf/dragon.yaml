# For quick deployment, configure a dragon.yaml file, either this one
# found in conf/ or create a copy, as shown below (without comments
# of course), and run the following command:
#
# bin/dragon.sh deploy PATH_TO_DISTRO/dragon-VERSION-distro.zip [USERNAME]
#
# where USERNAME is an optional parameter giving the username to scp/ssh
# to on the hosts. It is preferable to have public key access already
# setup with a key agent running.
# 
# The deploy command will upload the distribtion to the deploy directory,
# unpack it there, and upload an appropariate dragon.yaml specific to each host,
# it will then bring all of the dragon daemons online.

#dragon.network.hosts:
#- hostname: 192.168.1.2
#- hostname: 192.168.1.3
#dragon.deploy.dir: /home/ubuntu

# See the README.md file for extensive list of configuration parameters.
